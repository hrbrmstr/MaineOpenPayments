This repository contains Open Payments data for Maine doctors for 2013 (partial year), 2014 and 2015. 

These data are filtered from the very large nationwide Open Payments files, and are shared here to facilitate analysis for concerned Maine citizens.

The .csv files contain complete Open Payments data for Maine doctors. The R file contains the same information in data tables. 

The R file also includes three additional data tables – labeled "dopedocs_[year]" – that filter the Maine payments related to six prescription opioids (Zohydro, Oxycontin, Hynsingla, Butrans, Fentora and Subsys).
